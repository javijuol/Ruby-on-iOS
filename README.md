# Ruby-on-iOS


Before running the xCode project you should first compile ruby for the target environment.
To make thinks easier, the source includes a shell script ready to execute for compile and patch Ruby 2.2.1.
Just run ./compile_ruby.sh in a Terminal.
After script execution the project should be ready to run on the simulator.
